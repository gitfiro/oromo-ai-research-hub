# Oromo AI Roadmap

## Project objective

Oromo AI is building an open, research-grade Afaan Oromoo AI stack with a deliberate progression from validated data to language modeling, instruction tuning, evaluation, and applications.

Canonical component names used throughout this roadmap are **OromoCorpus** for the corpus family, **OromoTokenizer** for tokenizer research, **OromoLM** for the model family, and **OromoBench** for evaluation. See `docs/NAMING.md`.

The working sequence is:

```text
OromoCorpus
  ↓
OromoTokenizer research
  ↓
Causal base-model selection
  ↓
Tiny CPT proof
  ↓
Scale experiments
  ↓
Instruction tuning
  ↓
OromoBench
  ↓
Inference/API/applications
```

The project should not skip ahead simply because later stages are more visible.

The active OromoCorpus objective is **50 million net unique OromoLM-tokenizer tokens minimum**, with **100 million tokens preferred**. Counts are taken after cleaning and cross-source deduplication; evaluation holdouts and separately labeled synthetic data do not count toward this natural-language target.

---

## Phase 0 — Repository and research foundation

**Status: complete**

Completed:

- repository structure;
- Python/uv environment;
- testing framework;
- project-level data directories;
- model/training/evaluation scaffolding.

---

## Phase 1 — Corpus ingestion and provenance

**Status: complete for initial production source**

Completed:

- AfriBERTa Oromo source ingestion;
- stable source identifiers;
- record schema;
- provenance metadata;
- source licensing documentation;
- raw/processed separation.

Initial source:

```text
castorini/afriberta-corpus
subset: afaanoromoo
license: Apache-2.0
```

---

## Phase 2 — Conservative cleaning and production corpus

**Status: complete for v0.1.2**

Current production corpus:

```text
afriberta_oromo_v0.1.2
```

Validated output:

```text
410,193 processed records
52,122,367 processed characters
614 primary quality rejections
34 duplicate-after-cleaning records
648 rejection-ledger entries
```

Processed SHA-256:

```text
6f990088c8fb319b46c9a25a1c463e7a700cc8d292da781cfcc44ac4391ee0f6
```

The cleaning philosophy remains conservative: remove demonstrable extraction/data noise without flattening dialect, orthography, politics, religion, style, or legitimate multilingual context.

---

## Phase 2B — OromoCorpus expansion

**Status: 50M minimum achieved; expansion toward 100M active**

Release milestones:

| Release | Net unique OromoLM tokens | Release requirement |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| OromoCorpus v0.2 | **50M minimum** | Multiple licensed source families, cross-source deduplication, and published mixture statistics |
| OromoCorpus v0.3 | **100M preferred** | Broader domain and dialect balance with reproducible source manifests |

The official total is calculated only after conservative cleaning and exact/near-duplicate removal across all included sources. The project will additionally report raw records, characters, whitespace tokens, and per-source retention so that the expansion remains auditable.

### Verified expansion progress — 2026-09-27

Using the Oromo Unigram 48K + byte-fallback research tokenizer as the current planning reference:

| Accepted source | Net-new records | 48K reference tokens | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| AfriBERTa Afaan Oromoo v0.1.2 | 410,193 | 9,587,934 | approved seed |
| Wikimedia omwiki v0.1 | 2,254 | 1,070,896 | approved/frozen |
| VOA Afaan Oromoo via WURA v0.1 | 9,510 | 1,899,811 | approved/frozen |
| WaxalNLP Oromo ASR v0.1 | 44,194 | 1,934,045 | approved/frozen |
| MADLAD-400 Oromo v0.2 | 18,704 | 17,873,390 | approved/frozen — ODC-BY |
| HPLT 3.0 gaz_Latn v0.1 | 26,655 | 19,771,727 | approved/frozen — CC0 packaging; underlying text caveat |
| **Accepted total** | **511,510** | **52,137,803** | **104.28% of v0.2 minimum** |

### MADLAD-400 approval

MADLAD-400 Oromo v0.2 is accepted under the upstream AllenAI MADLAD-400
dataset's published **ODC-BY** license. The project preserves AllenAI /
MADLAD-400 attribution and explicitly records that the approval relies on the
dataset-level license representation rather than independent clearance of
every underlying Common Crawl content item.

The approved artifact contributes **18,704 records / 17,873,390 48K-reference
tokens**. Provenance recovery independently mapped **1,917 records / 1,874,398
tokens (10.49%)** to official v1.5 URLs and timestamps across 182 domains; the
remaining source-level provenance is not independently verified, but this no
longer blocks project acceptance under the upstream dataset license.

See `docs/sources/MADLAD_400_LICENSE_DECISION.md`.

### HPLT 3.0 approval and 50M milestone

HPLT 3.0 `gaz_Latn` v0.1 contributes **26,655 records / 19,771,727
48K-reference tokens** after restricting the release to WDS bins 8–10,
cross-source exact/near deduplication, structural-quality screening, and a
full GlotLID v3 pass over the structurally clean candidate population.

The frozen artifact contains 26,570 `gaz_Latn` top-1 records and 85
`hae_Latn` top-1 records across 1,091 unique domains. Ambiguous,
strong-non-Oromo, structurally flagged, and WDS 5–7 material remain excluded
from v0.1.

HPLT licenses the dataset packaging under CC0 while stating that it does not
own the underlying extracted text. The project therefore records underlying
individual-content rights as not independently verified. See
`docs/sources/HPLT3_LICENSE_DECISION.md`.

```text
50M minimum achieved: 52,137,803 reference tokens
margin above 50M:       2,137,803 reference tokens
progress to 100M:       52.14%
```

The full WURA Oromo package remains under review and does not count toward the accepted total. WURA is currently used as a source-discovery/provenance layer; only independently rights-cleared subsets enter OromoCorpus.

MADLAD-400 Oromo completed exact deduplication, canonical near deduplication,
conservative quality triage, GlotLID-assisted language review, manual review,
48K-reference measurement, and provenance investigation before its v0.2
approval.

The frozen research-clean artifact contains **18,704 records / 17,873,390
reference tokens** and is now included in accepted OromoCorpus under the
upstream MADLAD-400 **ODC-BY** dataset license. Official v1.5 recovery covers
1,917 records across 182 domains; the remaining source-level provenance is
documented as not independently verified rather than omitted from the audit
trail.

With the 50M minimum achieved, the next-source strategy prioritizes progress toward 100M and corpus balance. New sources should materially improve domain, dialect, literary, educational, technical, public-information, or conversational coverage; raw size alone is no longer the primary constraint.

Primary work:

- maintain a source registry containing ownership, license, provenance, acquisition date, domain, dialect metadata, and redistribution constraints;
- audit and ingest additional public or explicitly licensed Oromo sources;
- perform source-specific native-speaker quality sampling;
- deduplicate at document, paragraph, and near-duplicate levels across sources;
- balance education, literature, news, public documents, technical material, cultural material, and conversational language;
- isolate OromoBench and other evaluation material before any training export;
- keep synthetic and machine-translated datasets versioned separately from the natural-language corpus.

The first expansion audit should measure the net contribution of each candidate source against `afriberta_oromo_v0.1.2`; raw advertised source size is not treated as usable yield.

## Phase 3 — OromoTokenizer research

**Status: baseline and custom-candidate experiments complete**

Completed:

- reusable tokenizer metric layer;
- deterministic benchmark harness;
- frozen 10,000-record evaluation holdout;
- alignment audit;
- unknown-token audit;
- established multilingual baselines;
- custom SentencePiece Unigram candidates;
- 16K/24K/32K/48K vocabulary sweep;
- 32K and 48K byte-fallback variants;
- leakage-safe 400,193-record tokenizer training corpus.

Frozen tokenizer evaluation sample:

```text
10,000 records
seed: 20260919
SHA-256:
369c4438beab0d619336448eab7e27aae29d0722fd089088dbf0b2addc3d81f5
```

Serious OromoTokenizer research references:

```text
oromo-unigram-32k-byte
oromo-unigram-48k-byte
```

Current strongest sequence-efficiency reference:

```text
oromo-unigram-48k-byte
1.4000 tokens/word
38.75% word fragmentation
61.25% single-token words
0 unknown tokens
```

These are **OromoTokenizer research candidates**, not a final production tokenizer.

`docs/TOKENIZER_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`

## Phase 4 — Causal-LM tokenizer and base-model research

**Status: Phase 4A and Phase 4B1 complete; strategy decision in progress**

### Phase 4A — native causal tokenizer benchmark

Completed on the frozen 10K Oromo holdout:

| Native tokenizer | Tok/Word | Frag % | Single % | UNK |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Gemma 3 1B | **2.7855** | **85.91%** | **14.09%** | 0 |
| Qwen3.5 0.8B | 2.9191 | 86.94% | 13.06% | 0 |
| Llama 3.2 1B | 3.0311 | 88.32% | 11.68% | 0 |
| Qwen3 0.6B | 3.0713 | 88.89% | 11.11% | 0 |
| Mistral 7B v0.3 | 3.3241 | 93.09% | 6.91% | 0 |

Gemma 3 currently has the most efficient native causal tokenizer of the tested families, but every native tokenizer remains substantially less sequence-efficient than the custom Oromo references.

### Phase 4B1 — whole-word vocabulary augmentation

Completed for:

- Llama 3.2 1B;
- Qwen3 0.6B;
- Gemma 3 1B.

Candidate words are derived only from the 400,193-record leakage-safe tokenizer-training split and ranked by:

```text
frequency × (native token pieces - 1)
```

Results:

| Model tokenizer | Native | +2K | +4K | +8K | +16K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Llama 3.2 1B | 3.0311 | 2.5705 | 2.4715 | 2.3716 | **2.2821** |
| Qwen3 0.6B | 3.0713 | 2.6063 | 2.5058 | 2.4049 | **2.3140** |
| Gemma 3 1B | 2.7855 | 2.4475 | 2.3692 | 2.2903 | **2.2172** |

The largest early gain occurs in the first few thousand additions. At +4K, all three tokenizers reach approximately 38% word fragmentation, close to the custom Oromo 48K reference. Token-per-word efficiency, however, remains well above the custom reference of 1.4000.

### Current decision point

Phase 4 has established that:

- native causal tokenizers cover Oromo but tokenize it inefficiently;
- whole-word vocabulary augmentation is highly effective for frequent lexical forms;
- augmentation preserves the original tokenizer vocabulary/ID space and appends new IDs;
- whole-word augmentation alone does not fully solve Oromo subword inefficiency.

Before model-level CPT begins, the next research decision is whether to:

1. proceed with a practical whole-word augmentation budget;
2. run a Phase 4B2 Oromo subword-augmentation experiment;
3. retain the native tokenizer despite sequence inflation; or
4. pursue deeper tokenizer replacement only if the evidence justifies its pretrained-embedding cost.

The base model must ultimately be selected from the combined evidence of tokenizer efficiency, model quality, architecture, license, compute requirements, and CPT feasibility—not tokenizer metrics alone.

## Phase 5 — Tiny OromoLM continued-pretraining proof

**Status: planned**

Target:

A small, affordable OromoLM proof that validates the complete training pipeline before scaling.

The proof should test:

- causal-LM data packing;
- tokenizer/model compatibility;
- checkpoint loading/saving;
- optimizer/scheduler configuration;
- mixed precision;
- gradient accumulation;
- loss behavior;
- validation loss;
- held-out Oromo improvement;
- catastrophic-forgetting controls;
- reproducibility.

Approximate model scale under consideration:

```text
~0.5B class
```

The exact model depends on Phase 4 evidence.

Success means the training architecture works and produces measurable Oromo-language gains. It does not mean the model is release-ready.

---

## Phase 6 — OromoLM-1B-class experiment

**Status: planned**

Only proceed after the tiny proof demonstrates:

- stable training;
- reproducible checkpoints;
- useful validation improvement;
- manageable compute cost;
- no major tokenizer/data failure.

This phase should establish whether additional model capacity produces enough value to justify later scaling.

---

## Phase 7 — Continued pretraining at selected scale

**Status: planned**

Primary objective:

Transfer a capable pretrained model's general reasoning and language abilities toward stronger Afaan Oromoo modeling through raw-text continual pretraining.

Important controls:

- Oromo/general-language mixture strategy;
- replay data where appropriate;
- learning-rate conservatism;
- checkpoint evaluation;
- catastrophic-forgetting checks;
- training-token accounting;
- exact data manifests.

---

## Phase 8 — Supervised fine-tuning

**Status: planned**

Only after the base model demonstrates meaningful Afaan Oromoo language modeling suitable for the OromoLM family.

SFT goals may include:

- Oromo instruction following;
- question answering;
- summarization;
- translation;
- structured generation;
- conversational behavior.

LoRA or QLoRA may be used where appropriate, but parameter-efficient tuning does not substitute for language acquisition through CPT.

---

## Phase 9 — OromoBench

**Status: in development / expands alongside model work**

Evaluation categories:

- orthography;
- grammar;
- morphology;
- vocabulary;
- comprehension;
- summarization;
- translation;
- reasoning;
- factuality;
- instruction following;
- safety.

Benchmark data must remain separated from training data.

---

## Phase 10 — Model release engineering

**Status: planned**

Before public release:

- model card;
- tokenizer card;
- training-data summary;
- license review;
- reproducibility notes;
- benchmark report;
- inference examples;
- limitations;
- safety evaluation;
- artifact checksums.

Model releases must use the `OromoLM-<size>` family convention. Instruction-tuned and specialized variants add a clear suffix, such as `OromoLM-1B-Instruct` or `OromoLM-1B-Translate`.

---

## Phase 11 — Applications

**Status: future**

Potential downstream systems:

- OromoLM-Instruct chat model;
- translation;
- retrieval/RAG;
- search;
- spelling/grammar tools;
- embeddings;
- ASR;
- TTS;
- developer API.

Applications come after validated model infrastructure, not before it.

        ↓
🔄 Expand accepted OromoCorpus from 52.14M toward the preferred 100M target
        ↓
🔄 Improve corpus domain/dialect balance while expanding toward 100M / publisher cluster
        ↓
⏳ Continue base-model + tokenizer strategy decision
        ↓
⏳ Tiny CPT proof
```

The immediate data task is to identify and audit the next high-yield, rights-clear Afaan Oromoo source or publisher cluster while preserving the partially recovered MADLAD provenance evidence. Each new source must pass provenance review, conservative quality processing, exact and near cross-source deduplication, and source-level manifest/report freezing before its tokens are added to the planning total.

Tokenizer/base-model research may continue in parallel, and a tiny CPT proof may validate the training architecture, but scaled continued pretraining waits for an evidence-backed expanded corpus.
