## What is Oromo AI?

**Oromo AI** is an independent open-source research and engineering project focused on building high-quality AI infrastructure for **Afaan Oromoo**.

The project follows a data-first path:

```text
licensed sources
      ↓
provenance + audit
      ↓
cleaning + deduplication
      ↓
OromoCorpus
      ↓
tokenizer research
      ↓
OromoLM continued pretraining
      ↓
OromoBench
      ↓
instruction tuning + applications
```

The goal is not to build a quick chatbot. The goal is to create reusable, documented, and reproducible infrastructure for Afaan Oromoo language modeling, translation, retrieval, evaluation, and future speech systems.

## Project components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OromoCorpus** | Versioned, provenance-tracked Afaan Oromoo training corpus | 🔄 Active expansion |

Canonical naming is documented in [`docs/NAMING.md`](docs/NAMING.md).

## Current status

### OromoCorpus

The current accepted corpus planning total is measured with the **Oromo Unigram 48K + byte-fallback tokenizer** as a research reference. It is **not yet the final OromoLM tokenizer**.

| Accepted source | Net-new records | 48K reference tokens |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| AfriBERTa Afaan Oromoo v0.1.2 | 410,193 | 9,587,934 |
| Wikimedia omwiki v0.1 | 2,254 | 1,070,896 |
| VOA Afaan Oromoo via WURA v0.1 | 9,510 | 1,899,811 |
| WaxalNLP Oromo ASR v0.1 | 44,194 | 1,934,045 |
| **Accepted total** | **466,151** | **14,492,686** |

### Research-qualified source on HOLD

MADLAD-400 Oromo v0.1 has passed technical processing, cross-source
deduplication, conservative language-quality review, tokenizer-reference
measurement, and a first provenance-recovery audit. Official MADLAD v1.5
provenance was recovered for **1,917 final research-clean records / 1,874,398
48K-reference tokens (10.49%)**. The remaining **16,787 records / 15,998,992
reference tokens** remain provenance-unresolved.

| Source | Research-clean records | 48K reference tokens | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| MADLAD-400 Oromo v0.1 | 18,704 | 17,873,390 | research hold |

Accepted OromoCorpus remains **14,492,686** 48K-reference tokens.

MADLAD contributes **17,873,390** additional research-clean tokens to a
separate technical pool of **32,366,076** tokens, but it is not counted toward
the accepted OromoCorpus. Provenance is only partially recovered and
source-level licensing review remains incomplete.

```text
OromoCorpus v0.2 minimum: 50,000,000 tokens
Current planning total:   14,492,686
Progress:                 28.99%
Remaining:                35,507,314

OromoCorpus v0.3 target: 100,000,000 tokens
Current progress:         14.49%
```

The full WURA Oromo package remains under source-level review and does not count as an accepted source by itself. Only independently audited and rights-cleared subsets are admitted.

The next corpus-expansion priority is to identify rights-clear sources or publisher clusters capable of contributing roughly **5M–15M+ net-new tokens**, while still accepting smaller sources when they add important domain or dialect diversity.

### OromoTokenizer

Tokenizer research has established:

| Tokenizer | Vocabulary | Tokens/word | Fragmentation | UNK |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Oromo Unigram 48K + byte fallback | 48,000 | **1.4000** | **38.75%** | 0 |
| Oromo Unigram 32K + byte fallback | 32,000 | 1.4495 | 40.83% | 0 |
| AfriBERTa | 70,006 | 1.6765 | 39.83% | 0 |

Native causal-model tokenizers were also benchmarked on the frozen Oromo evaluation set. Whole-word vocabulary augmentation improved fragmentation substantially, but it did not match the custom Oromo tokenizer's sequence efficiency.

Full results: [`docs/TOKENIZER_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`](docs/TOKENIZER_RESEARCH_REPORT.md).

### Build verification

At the latest verified checkpoint:

```text
104 tests passed
```

The test suite covers corpus schema, ingestion, cleaning, quality decisions, deduplication, validation, and source-registry behavior.

## Data principles

Oromo AI uses a provenance-first corpus policy.

Every accepted source should have:

- identifiable origin and ownership;
- an explicit license or training-use decision;
- immutable raw-source handling;
- conservative cleaning;
- exact and near-duplicate removal;
- reproducible hashes and manifests;
- source-level acceptance/rejection records;
- evaluation-data separation.

The pipeline intentionally avoids destructive normalization that could erase Qubee orthography, dialectal variation, morphology, punctuation, or legitimate multilingual context.

Detailed policy: [`docs/CLEANING_POLICY.md`](docs/CLEANING_POLICY.md).

Generated raw/interim corpus artifacts are intentionally kept out of Git where appropriate.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Inspect the source registry:

```bash
uv run python scripts/source_registry.py list
uv run python scripts/source_registry.py validate
```

The repository is research infrastructure under active development; commands and artifact formats may evolve as corpus and model work progresses.

## Contribution priorities

Useful contributions include:

- rights-clear Afaan Oromoo corpora;
- linguistic review and annotations;
- dialect and domain metadata;
- parallel corpora;
- tokenizer and evaluation research;
- benchmark construction;
- reproducible data-engineering improvements.

All contributed data must preserve clear provenance and licensing information.

## Project principle

> **Data before model. Evidence before scale.**

Oromo AI is being built one validated layer at a time.
